<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Mohamed Adel, and I am currently working as a Front-End Developer at Apex.
I focus on building responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
At Apex, I collaborate with designers and back-end developers to turn UI/UX designs into functional websites.
My responsibilities also include debugging, optimizing performance, and ensuring cross-browser compatibility.
I handle all these tasks as part of my daily work at the company to deliver high-quality web applications.</p>
